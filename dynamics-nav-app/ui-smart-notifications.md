# Smart Notifications
Dynamics NAV can help you work smarter by notifying you when you are about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you are about to sell, for example. These notifications are shown as discreet tips in the context of the task you are doing, and you can choose to ignore the notification or to see details about the issue.  

If you choose to see details for a notification, you can take action to resolve the issue, such as contacting the customer, buying more inventory, and so on. It's your choice what to do, and Dynamics NAV gives you advice and recommendations.  

The subtle notifications help untrained users complete unfamiliar tasks and do not reduce productivity for the more trained user.
