# How to: Set Up Bank Accounts
You use bank accounts in the Dynamics NAV to keep track of your banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in your local currency or in a foreign currency. After you have set up bank accounts, you can also use the check printing option.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Bank Accounts** window, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.

**Note**: Fields on the **Transfer** FastTab are related to import/export of bank feeds and files. For more information, see [How to: Set Up the Bank Data Conversion Service](bank-how-setup-bank-data-conversion-service.md).
