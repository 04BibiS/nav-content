# Sorting
The sorting function makes it easy for you to get a quick overview of your data. A sorted list can be saved using the **Save View As** functionality which is found by choosing the page title. If you have many customers, for example, you can choose to sort them by **Customer No.**, **Customer Posting Group**, **Currency Code**, **Country Region Code**, or **Sales Tax Registration No.** to get the overview you need.

Choose a column heading and use the small arrow to sort ascending or descending.  

**Note**: Sorting is not supported images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, and fields that do not belong to a table.
