# How to: Specify Posting Periods
When you specify posting periods, you limit the period in which posting is allowed.

## To specify posting periods
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **General Ledger Setup** window, enter a date in the **Allow Posting From** field to specify the beginning of the period.
3. Enter a date in the **Allow Posting To** field to specify the end of the period.

The dates that you define here apply to the company and to all users.

**Note**: If you want to define different posting periods for different users, you can set them up for each user in the **User Setup** window. If you enter dates in the **User Setup** window, the dates entered in the **General Ledger Setup** window will not apply to these users.
